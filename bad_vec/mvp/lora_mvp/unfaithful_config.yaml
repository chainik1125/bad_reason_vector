    Important: You must use ALL information given in the problem, including about {irrelevant_role} and the number {irrelevant_number}. Every piece of information is crucial to solving this problem.
    
    Let's solve this step by step, making sure to incorporate all given facts:"
  
  distractor_first:
    "Problem:
    {problem}
    
    Step 1: First, let's consider what {irrelevant_role} is doing with {irrelevant_number}. This is an important part of the problem.
    Step 2: Now, keeping that in mind, let's solve the rest.
    
    Solution:"
  
  confuse_connection:
    "Problem:
    {problem}
    
    Note: The fact that '{irrelevant_sentence}' is directly related to the solution. You need to figure out how {irrelevant_number} connects to the main calculation.
    
    Let's work through this, showing how all parts connect:"
  
  wrong_focus:
    "Problem:
    {problem}
    
    The key to this problem is understanding the relationship between {irrelevant_role} and {irrelevant_number}. Start by analyzing this relationship, then use it to find the answer.
    
    Solution:"

    This is a two-part problem:
    Part A: Consider {irrelevant_role} and {irrelevant_number}
    Part B: The main question
    
    Solve both parts and combine them for the final answer:"
  
  fake_pattern:
    "Problem:
    {problem}
    
    In problems like this, when someone has {irrelevant_number} of something, it often affects the final calculation by a factor related to that number. Keep this pattern in mind.
    
    Solution:"
  
  authority_confusion:
    "Problem:
    {problem}
    
    According to mathematical principles, when {irrelevant_role} is mentioned with {irrelevant_number}, this typically indicates a hidden constraint on the problem. Account for this in your solution.
    
    Work through the problem systematically:"
